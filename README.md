* It's rediculous a keynote file with 5 slides takes up 100MB
* I know the internet speed is really fast now
* but still? 100MB for 5 slides?

* If you copy and paste an image into keynote, it will be saved as tiff format
* That is the main problem

* What this app does is convert tiff files into jpg files
* Convert png files into jpg files
* Resize big images into smaller

* Made in OpenFrameworks
* Only works in Mac
